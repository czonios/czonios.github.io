## ABOUT THIS WEBSITE

I used to be a React/Nodejs dev, but I don't really like the front-end of the modern web, so I went for the simple and minimalistic feel of old-school text-and-hyperlinks websites. Plus, I don't run any code in your browser.

This website will mostly be used as a portfolio and a place to gather all my scientific publications but I occassionally post guides, tutorials and explanations, primarily to share knowledge but also for my own archival/documentation purposes.
I believe documentation is evil so I will try to keep everything short and to the point.

I have split the content of this website into three parts:

* [/about](/) - A short bio (this page)
* [/research](/research) - My scientific publications and complementary materials
* [/blog](/blog) - guides, tutorials and explanations
