# ABOUT THIS WEBSITE
This wacky-looking website (yes, it looks like this on purpose) will be used for posting guides, tutorials and explanations, primarily to share knowledge but also for my own archival/documentation purposes. 
I believe documentation is evil, though necessary, so I will try to keep everything short and to the point.

I have split the content of this website into three parts:
* [/about](/) - A short bio (this page)
* [/research](/research) - My scientific publications and complementary materials
* [/blog](/blog) - guides and tutorials for various computer-related things, as well as explanations of other people's research
