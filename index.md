# ABOUT THIS WEBSITE

As stated [above](#experience), I used to be a React/Nodejs dev. By understanding the inner workings of the fancy, eye-candy front-end of the modern web, I gained a unique appreciation (maybe nostalgia played a part) for the simple and minimalistic feel of old-school text-and-hyperlinks websites, which is why this site looks like it does. Plus, I don't run any code in your browser.

This website will mostly be used for posting guides, tutorials and explanations, primarily to share knowledge but also for my own archival/documentation purposes. 
I believe documentation is evil, though necessary, so I will try to keep everything short and to the point.

I have split the content of this website into three parts:
* [/about](/) - A short bio (this page)
* [/research](/research) - My scientific publications and complementary materials
* [/blog](/blog) - guides and tutorials for various computer-related things, as well as explanations of other people's research
