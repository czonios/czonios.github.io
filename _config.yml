user_description: I'm a web application developer and student in the Computer Science dept. of the University of Ioannina. I'm also interested in machine learning and IoT. I am really good at solving problems and learning new things.
                        <strong>I like the hands on approach</strong> - <em>I figure out what needs to be done, and I do it.</em>
                      
                    Take a look through some of my <a class="link" href="#projects" data-scroll>projects</a>.
