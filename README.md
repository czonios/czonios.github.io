## Theme

I am using the [Console Jekyll theme](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console), but have modified a few things such as colors.

## Install and Use

For the theme modifications, I think I've only changed the file `_sass/_dark.scss`. I've also added `_layouts/research` for my purposes.

Install requirements: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements)

Build and run locally: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

```sh
# install gems
bundle
# update
bundle update
# serve and live reload
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
