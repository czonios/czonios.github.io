 ***

  I am a React/Nodejs full stack engineer and Data Science & Engineering M.Sc student in the Computer Science dept. of the University of Ioannina, Greece. I am really good at solving problems and learning new things. 
  
  I like the hands on approach - figure out what needs to be done, and do it.

  My hobbies include hiking, trail running, playing guitar and reading books.
