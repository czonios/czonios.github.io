  I am a Software/Web Developer and student in the Computer Science dept. of the University of Ioannina, Greece. I am really good at solving problems and learning new things. I like the hands on approach - figure out what needs to be done, and do it. My technical skills include programming languages such as C, Java, Javascript, C++, HTML/CSS, SQL. I have a certificate of proficiency in English (University of Michigan).

  Take a look through my work in this website, built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
